# avg_constraints
This repo contains the code for a project that finds a feasible solution to a budgeting problem that avoids restraint boundaries

constraints2.py sets up the initial conditions for initial balance, savings, income, and expenses

average.py computes a feasible solution to the set of linear constraints by finding an average of random points
uniformly distributed accross the convex polytope.

report.py prints the findings in the console.
